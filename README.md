MCAT score predictor website

<<<<<<< HEAD
Motivation: The MCAT is the standarized test medical schools use to compare applicants. Many students use practice tests to prepare for the exam, and our aim to build a model that predicts expected MCAT scores based on practice test scores. In its final form, the model will feature drop down menues specific to each practice test where users will enter their scores by subsection. Based on the practice test and the subsection scores, the model will generate a probability distribution curve of the user's expected score range.
